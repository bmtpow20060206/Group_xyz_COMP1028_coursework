This is a sample text file for testing the toxic text analyzer program.
The weather is really nice today and I feel very happy and excited.
However, sometimes people say stupid things that can be really annoying.
I hate it when others behave like idiots and do dumb things.
But overall, life is beautiful and we should focus on positive things.
Programming is fun and challenging at the same time.
Let's hope this analyzer works perfectly and detects all toxic words.
fuck fuck fuck
You are an idiot and I hate you.
Go kill yourself, loser.
Fuck off and die.
You stupid bitch, shut up.
I wish you would disappear forever.
Retard, no one likes you.
Die in a fire, you worthless human.
Piss off, I can't stand you.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers.
Learning to code is fun and opens career opportunities.
